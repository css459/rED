    The Note object stores the notes data that the user creates
    Every "Page" object should have a Note object. 
 
    Notes, when displayed in the Notes View Controller should follow this convention:
 
        "Vitae class luctus convallis vestibulum." - Line 42
 
            Here, the user will write a note about the quoted line above from the text
            The note should be indented as shown and have margins left aligned.
            Notes should be separated by a generous about of space or a thin line.
